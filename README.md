MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.
Since each image has 28 by 28 pixels, we get a 28x28 array. We can flatten each array into a 28âˆ—28=784 dimensional vector. 
Each component of the vector is a value between zero and one describing the intensity of the pixel.
Thus, we generally think of MNIST as being a collection of 784-dimensional vectors.
We are doing PCA to reduce 784 dimesions to 2d for visualizing our data.
TSNE for dimension reduction.
Some Classification algorithm like :-KNN,Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression
